This app uses the package npm mysql to connect to a MySQL database and the package npm inquirer to prompt the users with questions.

The app first displays a table of all the available products in stock:

Then it asks users to select a product by id, and how much they would like to get.

Then it gives confirmation to the user about the order. If the inventory is not enough it will warn the user that their order can't be placed.

However if the order is succesful it will confirm the order and will give the total to the user.
